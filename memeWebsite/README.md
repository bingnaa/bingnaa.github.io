to run

Had issues initializing setting up git in terminal because of instructions: had to troubleshoot auth token, but it messed with some terminal stuff that I had set up for my other job so I just used Github Desktop.

Was inspired by my other class Blessed?Blursed/Cursed. Decided to make a website based on the bee movie meme. Used a html /p tag converter so I could make the ridiculously long script fit. Used a flex container and audio player, but didn't spend too much time on polishing it because it's more of a joke website than anything.

Glitch hosting was just pasting the github repo link into glitch. Honestly, will probably just live host on github because  have that set up already and used it for other projects. Just makes more sense to me, and glitch's interface is hard to look at.
