#wk3 assignment: dynamic web, javascript API

https://bingnaa.github.io/weather/hi.html

Based on this git example (javascript, weather API): https://github.com/muji786/weather-app (modified his Weather.js to change how the website formats itself.)

Prototype figma file for what I wanted to design: https://www.figma.com/file/U1Muco5OzFUUNZDXFxl9a7/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=qKk1ZP1LfPjqrEGe-1

If expanded, I would want to make it so I had a p5.js sketch for each weather setting.
