		<h5 data-scroll>Brief</h5>
		<p data-scroll class = "item">As someone who struggled to cook in college, I wanted to make a mockup for a potential recipe generator. I know fellow students in my program have suffered the same problems as me: not being able to cook because of budget and time constraints. Moreover, I know that it's difficult to even find the time/money to even learn how. I tried thinking of a creative way of addressing this, and I decided to think about how I could make cooking "fun" and accessible.</p>

	<div class="flex-container">
		<p data-scroll class = "item">I wanted the palette to have a vibrant and lively feel because I wanted the interface to feel "fun" and encouraging for those who are trying to learn these recipes. BD Supper Bold as a heading font helped amplify this feeling.</p>
		<p data-scroll class = "item"> Readability was a priority when considering how this app was going to be used. Georgia was specifically chosen for its readability and because I wanted a font that could be used in a traditional cookbook. </p>

		<h5 data-scroll>Reflection</h5>
		<p data-scroll class = "item"> If I had more time, I would have liked to build a more detailed and structured Care Plan interface that would help guide the user into creating a detailed and expansive guide for potential carers. I would have also liked to make the interface for matching pet owners more personable and customizable. </p>
		<p data-scroll class = "item"> Although this initially started as a passion project, this idea is something that I would actually like to expand on just because of the demonstrated need for a service like this. Owning an exotic pet is already inaccessible, costly, and difficult to find resources for: making resources accessible and educating potential exotic pet owners is a valuable cause that I do think goes overlooked. </p>
