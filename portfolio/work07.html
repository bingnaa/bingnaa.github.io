		<h5 data-scroll>Brief</h5>
		<p data-scroll class = "item">As someone who struggled to cook in college, I wanted to make a mockup for a potential recipe generator. I know fellow students in my program have suffered the same problems as me: not being able to cook because of budget and time constraints. Moreover, I know that it's difficult to even find the time/money to even learn how. I tried thinking of a creative way of addressing this, and I decided to think about how I could make cooking "fun" and accessible.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<h5 data-scroll>Problem</h5>
		<p data-scroll class = "item">Design a recipe generator that encourages experimentation in cooking.</p>

		<h5 data-scroll>Branding</h5>
		<div class="flex-box">
			<img src = "img/case 02/branding.png" class = "intFrame" data-scroll>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<p data-scroll class = "item">I wanted the palette to have a vibrant and lively feel because I wanted the interface to feel "fun" and encouraging for those who are trying to learn these recipes. BD Supper Bold as a heading font helped amplify this feeling.</p>
		<p data-scroll class = "item"> Readability was a priority when considering how this app was going to be used. Georgia was specifically chosen for its readability and because I wanted a font that could be used in a traditional cookbook. </p>

<!-- 	User testing -->

		<h5 data-scroll>User Testing</h5>

		<h5 data-scroll>Features</h5>
		<h6 data-scroll class = "item">Designing for the User</h6>
		<p data-scroll class = "item">I implemented the feedback that I received into making the recipes more detailed so a user knows exactly how long and what price a recipe is supposed to be.</p>
		<p data-scroll class = "item">Additionally, I added a Library Manager to keep track recipes that have been generated so a user can revisit them if they want to.</p>

<!-- 	Search Parameters -->
	<div class="flex-container">
		<h6 data-scroll class = "item">Search Parameters</h6>
		<p data-scroll class = "item"> I decided to create four categories: cuisine, time limit, budget, and difficulty. I changed the interface based on suggestions and added sliders for a more personalized range.</p>
		<p data-scroll class = "item"> I also added the option to decide what sort of appliances that a recipe can use: this is to help users who may live in housing situations (like student dorms) where they are limited by what appliances are available to them.</p>

	<div class="flex-container">
		<h5 data-scroll>Reflection</h5>
		<p data-scroll class = "item">With more time I would want to increase search parameters so that it could filter out certain ingredients or even cuisines; maybe even have it so that the generator could categorize and sort food by taste.</p>
		<p data-scroll class = "item">This exercise taught me the importance of feedback and how data can be interpretated by different people: in my testing phase, I received feedback</p>
