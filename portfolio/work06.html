		<p data-scroll class = "item">Specifically, the patient had to be able to: upload a picture of the bill, understand the bill, and pay the bill through this interface. </p>

		<p data-scroll class = "item">This design challenge was specifically catered to John Smith, and an example bill was given to extract and breakdown information from. There was an assumption that the interface could accurately extract information from the bill, and there was no need to design anything that might potentially troubleshoot any wrong information that was inputted by the system.</p>
		<p data-scroll class = "item">My process focused on finding a way to make the bill more readable: how could the information be simplified so that the patient knew what to focus on? Furthermore, I wanted to keep in mind Truffle's branding when making my design choices; I wanted it to feel cohesive with the current, existing website.</p>

Also there was a lack of knowledge in how this interface was supposed to function with the current Truffle Health billing infrastructure as it currently is not public.</p>
