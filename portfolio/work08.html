		<h5 data-scroll>Brief</h5>
		<p data-scroll class = "item">I wanted to experiment with creating a mobile music/rhythm gaming interface. The interface itself was inspired by the aesthetics of the video games Gris and Journey: both games involved internal reflection being reflected by a physical journey, and I wanted to replicate that sort of feeling through this interface.</p>

			<img src = "img/case03/elypalette.png" class = "intFrame" data-scroll>
	</div>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<p data-scroll class = "item">Font used was Trade Gothic Next SR Pro and Trade Gothic Next LT Pro: both of these fonts were chosen for their readability and for how "plain" the font feels. Furthermore, the prominent use of black/white/grey in this interface is a reminder of how "lost" this character is. The other colors correlate to the potential worlds that the user is going to visit.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="flex-container">
		<p data-scroll class = "item">I tried to make the home screen/menu screens have animations that played with perspective while not being overwhelmingly busy. Added to make the interface less flat and more playful to look at. When practically implemented, element would be transformed by iPhone's physical movement (when the iPhone is being tilted up/down or left/right).</p>

	<div class="flex-container">
		<p data-scroll class = "item">Menu interface is shaped like a "hand" to mimic the hand motif that exist in the home/menu screens. The palette of the game is also reflected in this interface while also hinting about the potential worlds to unlock: desert (red), sky (blue), forest (green), and mountain (yellow-brown).</p>

	<div class="flex-container">
		<p data-scroll class = "item"> I made it so that the button animations feel like they were "bleeding" like watercolor does. Couldn't implement the animations into Adobe XD, but I wanted this animation to occur once the button is tapped before transitioning to next screen. </p>

	<div class="flex-container">
		<p data-scroll class = "item">I modeled this prototype to reflect a general idea of how I would want the selection process to look like. The environment in this prototype for the actual rhythm game is in the desert world, but when playing the rhythm game in other "worlds", I want it to match whatever "world" it's being played in. Hypothetically, once more worlds are unlocked, different backgrounds for the rhythm game is unlocked. Moreover, the palette for the "tap" and "long press" elements would change with these environments, and the potential obstacles would also change (i.e. switching the sandstorm with clouds in a "sky" world).</p>

		<p data-scroll class = "item">If I had more time, I would like to expand on the potential worlds and creating each interface for each world rather than just the desert world. I would have also liked to experiment with sound and maybe making a playable prototype through coding.</p>
