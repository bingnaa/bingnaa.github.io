		<p class = "item">Specifically, the patient had to be able to: upload a picture of the bill, understand the bill, and pay the bill through this interface.Â </p>

		<p class = "item">This design challenge was specifically catered to John Smith, and an example bill was given to extract and breakdown information from. There was an assumption that the interface could accurately extract information from the bill, and there was no need to design anything that might potentially troubleshoot any wrong information that was inputted by the system.</p>

Also there was a lack of knowledge in how this interface was supposed to function with the current Truffle Health infrastructure.</p>
