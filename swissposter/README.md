Did the assignment and geniunely missed the part of it being about New York. Had a bunch of ocean related assets from another class and just decided to integrate into a website. Had a very general simple idea for fish themed punny-ish website. Wanted to implement some javascript to make some simple movement. Deployed it to github just through github desktop and coded with visual studio.

got the marquee code here: https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-have-the-marquee-effect-without-using-the-marquee-tag-with-css-javascript-and-jquery.html
Styled it to better fit the website.
